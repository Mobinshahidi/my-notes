## ðŸ“˜ **Detailed Answers**

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy

1. A **process** is a program in execution, with its own memory and resources.
2. Code (text), data (variables), stack (function calls), heap (dynamic memory).
3. **PCB** stores process info like state, PID, CPU registers, scheduling info.
4. New â†’ Ready â†’ Running â†’ Waiting â†’ Terminated
5. A **program** is a passive file; a **process** is the active execution of that file.
6. The stack holds **function calls**, **return addresses**, and **local variables**.
7. `fork()` in UNIX duplicates the current process.
8. **Ready queue**: waiting for CPU
   **I/O queue**: waiting for I/O device
9. **Context switch** = saving the current process state and restoring another's.
10. Its resources are reclaimed, and its status is stored for parent (if any) to read.

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium

1. **Parent** spawns the child using `fork()`; **child** inherits resources and executes separately.
2. **Zombie**: finished process, not yet cleaned by parent.
   **Orphan**: child still running after parent exits.
3. `fork()` copies the process; `exec()` replaces the processâ€™s memory with a new program.
4. It causes **overhead**, since saving/restoring CPU state takes time.
5. **PID** identifies a process. **PPID** links to its parent.
6. * **Long-term**: selects jobs for admission
   * **Short-term**: picks ready processes for CPU
   * **Medium-term**: swaps processes in/out of memory
7. * Save current process's PCB state
   * Load new process's PCB state
   * Update CPU registers and program counter
8. The **PCB** acts as the OS's way to track and manage each process.
9. The CPU must be shared fairly among all active processes â†’ scheduler does this.
10. `wait()` blocks a parent until the child finishes â†’ prevents zombie buildup.

### ðŸ”´ Hard

1. **Process Lifecycle**:
   New â†’ Ready â†’ Running â†’ (Waiting â†” Ready) â†’ Terminated
   (Context switch happens between Ready â†” Running)

2. * Shell runs `fork()` to duplicate itself
   * In child: `exec()` replaces memory with new program
   * Parent waits or continues

3. **Fairness** via scheduling algorithms like **multilevel queues**, which separate CPU-bound (compute-heavy) and I/O-bound (fast I/O) processes to ensure balance.

4. **Multitasking** means running multiple apps at once.
   OS switches between them using **context switching**, giving illusion of parallelism.

5. * **IPC** allows processes to cooperate or communicate.
   * **Shared Memory** is fast but complex to sync.
   * **Message Passing** is simpler but slower due to system call overhead.

6. * **Blocking** waits for the message â†’ simpler, easier sync
   * **Non-blocking** continues immediately â†’ faster but harder to manage

7. OS uses **locks**, **semaphores**, or **monitors** to protect shared resources and avoid race conditions.

8. **Signals** are used to interrupt or notify processes (e.g., `SIGKILL`, `SIGCHLD`).

9. * **Direct**: sender & receiver name each other
   * **Indirect**: use a mailbox/port abstraction to send messages

10. * Parent can spawn multiple children = **process tree**
    * Process groups allow managing multiple processes together (e.g., job control in UNIX)
