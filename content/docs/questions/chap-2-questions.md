## ðŸ“˜ **Detailed Answers**

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy

1. **User services** (UI, I/O, files, execution) and **system services** (resource allocation, protection, logging).
2. **CLI** uses text commands; **GUI** provides visual interaction with icons and windows.
3. An **API** allows user programs to access OS functions via system calls.
4. A **system program** supports OS functions (e.g., file manipulation, compilers).
5. A **linker** combines object files into a single executable.
6. **Compilation**: source â†’ object file; **Linking**: object files â†’ executable.
7. **Dynamic linking** loads libraries at runtime instead of build time.
8. Because OS provides access to hardware and system resources, apps can't work without it.
9. **ELF** (Executable and Linkable Format).
10. The **loader** loads executables into memory and prepares them to run.

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium

1. **CLI**: text-based, powerful for experts.
   **GUI**: user-friendly, visual interface (Windows, macOS).
   **Touch UI**: intuitive for mobile (iOS, Android).
2. An **API** is a programming interface. System calls are how those APIs are implemented in the OS.
3. System programs manage OS-level tasks; application programs serve the user.
4. Multiple processes can use one copy of a **dynamic library**, reducing memory use.
5. Because different OSes have different system calls, file formats, and hardware interfaces.
6. Shell runs â†’ fork() to create process â†’ exec() to load program â†’ loader brings it to memory.
7. **ELF** is a standard binary format used in Linux for object files and executables.
8. **System call**: kernel-level action (e.g., `write()`).
   **Library function**: wrapper (e.g., `printf()` calls `write()`).
9. **Object files** are intermediate files compiled from source code before linking.
10. **Relocation** adjusts memory addresses in the code to match its actual position in memory.

### ðŸ”´ Hard

1. **Monolithic**:

   * Fast, tight integration
     âˆ’ Hard to maintain/debug

   **Layered**:

   * Good modularity
     âˆ’ Slower due to strict hierarchy

   **Microkernel**:

   * Secure, modular
     âˆ’ Overhead for message passing

2. **Policy** = What to do; **Mechanism** = How to do it.
   Separation allows flexibility (change policy without rewriting mechanism).

3. **APIs** may work, but the underlying system calls or behaviors differ, breaking compatibility.

4. Flow:
   Source code â†’ Compiler â†’ Object file â†’ Linker â†’ Executable â†’ Loader â†’ Memory â†’ CPU executes

5. Dynamic linking saves space and allows updates to libraries without recompiling the app.

6. Virtualization adds a layer between hardware and OS, so OS must support running as a guest or manage virtual hardware.

7. Android uses **Linux kernel**, but app layer is **Java-based**. Combines monolithic kernel + managed runtime.

8. **macOS** uses **Mach microkernel** for low-level services, and **BSD layer** for user-facing Unix-like environment.

9. **POSIX** standardizes APIs (e.g., `fork()`, `open()`), but platforms like Windows have different APIs.

10. **Portability issues**:

* Different hardware instruction sets
* OS-specific syscalls
* Binary format incompatibilities
