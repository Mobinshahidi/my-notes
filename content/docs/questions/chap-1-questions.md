## ðŸŸ¢ EASY â€“ Detailed Answers

1. **What is an operating system?**
   An OS is system software that manages hardware and software resources and provides services for programs.

2. **Name four components of a computer system.**
   Hardware, Operating System, Application Programs, Users.

3. **What is the function of the kernel?**
   It's the core of the OS, always running, managing memory, processes, I/O, and hardware.

4. **Define "resource allocator" in OS.**
   The OS manages and allocates CPU time, memory, and I/O resources among users and applications.

5. **What does "control program" mean in OS terminology?**
   A program that controls execution to prevent errors and improper use of the system.

6. **Name one volatile and one non-volatile memory type.**
   Volatile: RAM; Non-volatile: SSD/HDD/EEPROM.

7. **What does a device controller do?**
   It's hardware that manages communication between a device and the system's bus/memory.

8. **What is the purpose of the bootstrap program?**
   It initializes the system when the computer is powered on and loads the OS into memory.

9. **What is the role of a system call?**
   It's the interface between user applications and OS services (e.g., file access, I/O).

10. **What is a trap in operating systems?**
    A software-generated interrupt, triggered by errors or specific instructions (e.g., divide by zero).

## ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM â€“ Detailed Answers

1. **How does an OS handle multiple I/O requests at once?**
   Through **interrupts**, **device queues**, and sometimes **DMA** to parallelize and manage efficiently.

2. **Difference between system program and application program?**
   System: supports OS (e.g., compiler, shell). Application: user-facing (e.g., browser, games).

3. **Multiprogramming vs Multitasking?**
   Multiprogramming: multiple processes in memory.
   Multitasking: fast switching between tasks, giving the illusion of parallelism.

4. **How do interrupts improve CPU efficiency?**
   They let the CPU work on other tasks instead of waiting for I/O to finish.

5. **What is the purpose of a memory controller?**
   It manages access to RAM and ensures orderly read/write operations between devices and memory.

6. **Symmetric vs Asymmetric Multiprocessing?**
   SMP: all processors are equal.
   AMP: one master processor controls others (less flexible).

7. **How do timers help control processes?**
   They interrupt processes after a time slice, enabling multitasking and avoiding infinite loops.

8. **Function of memory hierarchy in performance?**
   Faster, smaller memory (like cache) sits closer to CPU; large, slow storage (like HDD) stores long-term data.

9. **Why is cache needed?**
   To bridge speed gap between CPU and main memory, reducing latency and improving performance.

10. **Role of device driver in I/O?**
    A software layer that translates OS commands into hardware-specific signals for the device controller.

## ðŸ”´ HARD â€“ Detailed Answers

1. **Steps from compiling to execution:**
   Source code â†’ Compiler â†’ Object files â†’ Linker â†’ Executable â†’ Loader â†’ Process created â†’ CPU executes.

2. **How does OS protect using user/kernel modes?**
   By running user programs in restricted user mode; kernel mode has full privileges. Switching is controlled via traps/system calls.

3. **Why binary from one OS may not run on another:**

   * Different CPU architecture (e.g., ARM vs x86)
   * Different binary format (ELF vs PE)
   * Different system calls/APIs
   * Linked libraries missing
   * OS-specific dependencies

4. **OS Structures:**

   * **Monolithic**: All functionality in one large kernel (e.g., Linux).
   * **Microkernel**: Only essentials in kernel, others in user space (e.g., QNX).
   * **Modular**: Kernel can load/unload parts (e.g., Linux modules).

5. **Why use system calls instead of direct hardware access?**
   System calls ensure controlled, secure, and consistent access to hardware, reducing risks and improving stability.

6. **Virtualization benefits:**
   OS can simulate multiple machines â†’ better hardware utilization, isolation, and flexibility (e.g., VMs, containers).

7. **NUMA challenges:**
   Accessing remote memory is slower than local memory. Requires smart memory allocation and process placement.

8. **Consequences of no memory protection:**

   * A faulty/malicious process can overwrite others
   * System crashes
   * Security breaches

9. **Role of OS in cluster computing:**
   Coordinates resource sharing, job distribution, fault tolerance, and communication between nodes.

10. **Cache coherence across cores:**
    OS (and hardware protocols like MESI) must ensure that changes in one coreâ€™s cache are reflected in others or flushed to memory.
