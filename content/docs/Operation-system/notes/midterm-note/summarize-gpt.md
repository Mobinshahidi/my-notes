## Chapter 1 — Introduction

### 1.1 What Operating Systems Do

* OS = bridge between user and hardware
* **User View**: UI, easy use, good UX
* **System View**: Resource manager (CPU, memory, etc.)
* OS is a **control program** and **resource allocator**

### 1.2 Computer-System Organization

* Components: CPU, memory, I/O, system bus
* Programs stored in **main memory**
* **I/O via device controller → local buffer**
* **Interrupts** used to notify CPU of events

### 1.3 Computer-System Architecture

| Architecture  | Features                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| **SMP**       | Equal CPUs, shared memory |
| **Multicore** | Faster on-chip cores      |
| **NUMA**      | Local + shared memory     |
| **Clustered** | Networked machines        |

### 1.4 OS Operations

* **Multiprogramming**: multiple processes in memory
* **Multitasking**: switching via context switch
* **Dual-Mode**: User mode vs. Kernel mode
* **Timer**: Prevents infinite loops in processes

### 1.5 Process & Resource Management

* OS manages:

  * **Processes** (executes code)
  * **Memory** (RAM, paging)
  * **Files & Storage** (file system)
  * **I/O Devices** (via drivers)
  * **Cache** & **Virtual Memory**

### 1.6 Protection & Security

* **Protection**: Internal safety between processes
* **Security**: External access control (users, networks)

### 1.7 Kernel Data Structures

* **Lists, trees, hash tables**
* Used to manage processes, memory, files
* Critical for performance

## Chapter 2 — OS Structure

### 2.1 OS Services

| Category   | Service                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| For Users  | UI, program execution, I/O, files, comms, error handling |
| For System | Resource allocation, logging, protection/security        |

### 2.2 User-OS Interface

* **CLI**: Command interpreter (e.g., Bash, Shell)
* **GUI**: Desktop metaphor (Windows, Mac)
* **Touch**: iOS, Android → screen gestures
* **Choice**: Developers often prefer CLI; users prefer GUI

### 2.3 System Calls

| Type             | Example                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Process control  | fork(), exec(), exit()           |
| File management  | open(), read(), write(), close() |
| Device control   | ioctl(), read(), write()         |
| Info maintenance | getpid(), alarm()                |
| Comm             | pipe(), shmget()                 |

* **API** connects app code to system calls
* Example: `printf()` → `write()` system call

### 2.4 System Programs

* **Utility tools**: text editors, compilers, loaders
* Support **program development** & **I/O mgmt**
* Includes background services (daemons)

### 2.5 Linkers and Loaders

* **Compiler** → object file (.o)
* **Linker** → combines to executable
* **Loader** → places in memory & runs it
* **Dynamic Linking**: Load library during run-time

### 2.6 OS-Specific Applications

* Apps usually OS-specific because:

  * **Different system calls**
  * **Different binary formats**
  * **Different instruction sets**
* 3 cross-platform methods:

  * Interpreted languages (Python)
  * VM (Java)
  * Ported APIs (POSIX)

### 2.7 OS Design & Implementation

* Design: Based on system goals (user/system)
* **Policy vs Mechanism**:

  * Mechanism = how
  * Policy = what
* Most OSes written in **C**, with some assembly

### 2.8 OS Structures

| Structure       | Features                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Monolithic**  | All in one kernel (Linux)                    |
| **Layered**     | Modules stacked (hard to optimize)           |
| **Microkernel** | Minimal core, rest in user space (Mach, QNX) |
| **Modules**     | Dynamically loadable (Linux modules)         |
| **Hybrid**      | Combo of above (Windows, macOS, Android)     |

#### 2.8.5 Case Studies:

* **macOS**: Aqua GUI + Mach microkernel + BSD
* **iOS**: Like macOS but stricter and ARM-based
* **Android**: Linux kernel + Java API + ART runtime
* **WSL**: Run Linux apps on Windows via syscall mapping

## Chapter 3 — Processes

### 3.1 Process Concept

* A **process** = program in execution
* Has: code, data, heap, stack
* Process control block (PCB) stores: PID, state, PC, registers, memory info

### 3.2 Process Scheduling

| Queue Type | Purpose         |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| Ready      | Waiting for CPU |
| Device     | Waiting for I/O |

* **Context switch**: OS saves and loads process state between executions

### 3.3 Operations on Processes

* Create: `fork()` (Unix), `CreateProcess()` (Windows)
* End: `exit()`, or killed
* **Zombie**: Ended but parent hasn't read exit status
* **Orphan**: Parent exits before child

### 3.4–3.5 Interprocess Communication (IPC)

| Method          | Speed  | Use                          |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| Shared Memory   | Fast   | Local processes              |
| Message Passing | Slower | Local + Remote communication |

* Sync types: blocking vs non-blocking
* Buffer types: zero, bounded, unbounded

### 3.6 Examples of IPC

* Pipes: allow communication between related processes
* Named Pipes (FIFO): unrelated processes, bidirectional

## Chapter 4 — Threads & Concurrency

### 4.1 Overview

* **Thread** = basic unit of CPU execution
* Threads in same process share: code, data, files
* Each thread has: PC, registers, stack

### 4.2 Multicore Programming

* **Concurrency**: multiple tasks at once (not necessarily parallel)
* **Parallelism**: actual simultaneous execution
* Types:

  * Task Parallelism: separate tasks in parallel
  * Data Parallelism: same task on different data

### 4.3 Thread Models

| Model        | Mapping                      | Parallelism |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| Many-to-One  | Many user threads → 1 kernel | ❌           |
| One-to-One   | 1 user ↔ 1 kernel thread     | ✅           |
| Many-to-Many | Many user ↔ many kernel      | ✅           |

### 4.4 Thread Libraries

| Library | Platform    | Notes                     |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| POSIX   | Unix/Linux  | Portable API              |
| Windows | Windows OS  | Kernel-supported          |
| Java    | JVM-managed | Threads via Java programs |

* **User-level threads**: fast, no kernel help
* **Kernel-level threads**: OS-managed, more powerful

## Chapter 5 — CPU Scheduling

### 5.1 Basic Concepts

* **CPU Scheduling** = selecting which ready process runs next
* **Preemptive**: can stop a process mid-execution
* **Non-preemptive**: process runs till end or blocks

### 5.2 Scheduling Criteria

| Criterion       | Goal     |
| --------------- | -------- |
| CPU Utilization | Maximize |
| Throughput      | Maximize |
| Turnaround Time | Minimize |
| Waiting Time    | Minimize |
| Response Time   | Minimize |

### 5.3 Scheduling Algorithms

| Algorithm           | Type           | Details                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| FCFS                | Non-preemptive | Convoy effect; simple                     |
| SJF / SRTF          | Both           | Optimal avg time; needs prediction        |
| Round Robin (RR)    | Preemptive     | Time quantum; fair for time-sharing       |
| Priority Scheduling | Both           | Starvation risk → fix with **aging**      |
| Multilevel Queue    | Mixed          | Fixed queues (e.g. foreground/background) |
| Multilevel Feedback | Adaptive       | Dynamic queue movement based on behavior  |
