# Chapter 5: CPU Scheduling ‚ö°

## 5.1 Basic Concepts üéØ

### 5.1.1 CPU-I/O Burst Cycle üîÑ

Process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait:
- **CPU Burst**: Period when process is executing instructions on the CPU
- **I/O Burst**: Period when process is waiting for I/O completion
- **Pattern**: Process execution begins with CPU burst, followed by I/O burst, then CPU burst, and so on

#### Characteristics of CPU Bursts
- **Distribution**: Large number of short CPU bursts and small number of long CPU bursts
- **Typical Pattern**: Many processes have short CPU bursts (1-8 milliseconds)
- **CPU-bound processes**: Few long CPU bursts
- **I/O-bound processes**: Many short CPU bursts
- **Histogram Shape**: Exponential or hyperexponential curve with high frequency of short bursts

### 5.1.2 CPU Scheduler üéõÔ∏è

**Definition**: The CPU scheduler (short-term scheduler) selects which process in the ready queue should be allocated the CPU next.

#### When CPU Scheduling Occurs
CPU scheduling decisions take place when a process:
1. **Switches from running to waiting state** (e.g., I/O request, wait for child termination)
2. **Switches from running to ready state** (e.g., interrupt occurs)
3. **Switches from waiting to ready state** (e.g., I/O completion)
4. **Terminates**

#### Types of Scheduling
- **Nonpreemptive (Cooperative) Scheduling**: 
  - Scheduling occurs only under circumstances 1 and 4
  - Process keeps CPU until it releases it voluntarily
  - Used in Windows 3.x and early Macintosh
  
- **Preemptive Scheduling**:
  - Scheduling can occur under all four circumstances
  - Process can be forcibly removed from CPU
  - Used in modern operating systems
  - **Advantage**: Better response time and fairness
  - **Disadvantage**: Requires special hardware (timer interrupt) and careful design

#### Preemption Considerations
**Race Conditions**: 
- Can occur when preemption happens during kernel mode execution
- **Solution**: Wait for system call completion or I/O block before context switch
- **Alternative**: Use kernel synchronization primitives

**Interrupt Handling**:
- Interrupts can occur at any time
- Kernel must be designed to handle interrupts properly during critical sections

### 5.1.3 Dispatcher üöÄ

**Definition**: The dispatcher gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the CPU scheduler.

#### Dispatcher Functions
1. **Context switching**: Save state of current process, load state of new process
2. **Mode switching**: Switch from kernel mode to user mode
3. **Jump to proper location**: Resume execution at the correct instruction in user program

#### Dispatch Latency
- **Definition**: Time taken by dispatcher to stop one process and start another
- **Components**:
  - Time to save context of current process
  - Time to load context of new process
  - Time for mode switch and instruction jump
- **Goal**: Minimize dispatch latency for better system responsiveness
- **Typical Range**: Few microseconds to milliseconds

## 5.2 Scheduling Criteria üìä

### 5.2.1 Performance Metrics üìà

Different scheduling algorithms optimize for different criteria:

#### CPU Utilization üíπ
- **Definition**: Percentage of time the CPU is busy executing processes
- **Goal**: Maximize CPU utilization
- **Range**: 0% to 100%
- **Real Systems**: 40% (lightly loaded) to 90% (heavily loaded)
- **Formula**: CPU Utilization = (Total CPU Busy Time / Total Time) √ó 100%

#### Throughput üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- **Definition**: Number of processes completed per unit time
- **Goal**: Maximize throughput
- **Measurement Units**: Processes per second, processes per minute, processes per hour
- **Factors**: Depends on process length and system load
- **Example**: 10 processes/second for short processes vs 1 process/hour for long processes

#### Turnaround Time ‚è±Ô∏è
- **Definition**: Total time from process submission to completion
- **Formula**: Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- **Components**: 
  - Waiting time in ready queue
  - CPU execution time
  - I/O waiting time
- **Goal**: Minimize average turnaround time
- **User Perspective**: Most important metric for batch systems

#### Waiting Time ‚è≥
- **Definition**: Total time process spends waiting in the ready queue
- **Formula**: Sum of all time periods spent in ready queue
- **Excludes**: CPU execution time and I/O waiting time
- **Goal**: Minimize average waiting time
- **Impact**: Directly affects user satisfaction

#### Response Time üéØ
- **Definition**: Time from request submission until first response is produced
- **Formula**: Response Time = Time of First Response - Arrival Time
- **Difference from Turnaround**: Measures time to begin responding, not time to complete
- **Goal**: Minimize average response time
- **Critical for**: Interactive and real-time systems
- **User Experience**: Affects perceived system responsiveness

### 5.2.2 Optimization Goals üéØ

#### General Principles
- **CPU Utilization**: Maximize (keep CPU as busy as possible)
- **Throughput**: Maximize (complete more processes per unit time)
- **Turnaround Time**: Minimize (reduce total completion time)
- **Waiting Time**: Minimize (reduce time spent waiting)
- **Response Time**: Minimize (improve interactive experience)

#### Trade-offs
- **Throughput vs Response Time**: Optimizing for high throughput may increase response time
- **Fairness vs Efficiency**: Fair scheduling may reduce overall system efficiency
- **Average vs Maximum**: Minimizing average response time may increase maximum response time

#### System-Specific Optimization
- **Batch Systems**: Emphasize throughput and turnaround time
- **Interactive Systems**: Emphasize response time
- **Real-time Systems**: Emphasize meeting deadlines
- **Server Systems**: Balance between throughput and response time

## 5.3 Scheduling Algorithms üìã

### 5.3.1 First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Principle**: Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.

#### Algorithm Description
- **Implementation**: Using FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue
- **Process Selection**: Always select the process at the head of the queue
- **Preemption**: Nonpreemptive algorithm
- **Simplicity**: Easiest scheduling algorithm to understand and implement

#### FCFS Example
**Processes with CPU burst times**:
- P‚ÇÅ: 24ms, P‚ÇÇ: 3ms, P‚ÇÉ: 3ms
- Arrival order: P‚ÇÅ, P‚ÇÇ, P‚ÇÉ

**Gantt Chart**:
```
P‚ÇÅ        P‚ÇÇ   P‚ÇÉ
0    24   27   30
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Waiting Times**: P‚ÇÅ = 0ms, P‚ÇÇ = 24ms, P‚ÇÉ = 27ms
- **Average Waiting Time**: (0 + 24 + 27)/3 = 17ms
- **Turnaround Times**: P‚ÇÅ = 24ms, P‚ÇÇ = 27ms, P‚ÇÉ = 30ms
- **Average Turnaround Time**: (24 + 27 + 30)/3 = 27ms

#### FCFS with Different Arrival Order
**Same processes, different order**: P‚ÇÇ, P‚ÇÉ, P‚ÇÅ

**Gantt Chart**:
```
P‚ÇÇ   P‚ÇÉ   P‚ÇÅ
0    3    6    30
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Waiting Times**: P‚ÇÅ = 6ms, P‚ÇÇ = 0ms, P‚ÇÉ = 3ms
- **Average Waiting Time**: (6 + 0 + 3)/3 = 3ms
- **Improvement**: 17ms ‚Üí 3ms (significant improvement)

#### Convoy Effect üöõ
- **Definition**: Short processes get stuck behind long processes
- **Problem**: Poor performance when long CPU burst process arrives first
- **Impact**: Reduces CPU and device utilization
- **Example**: All processes wait for one long process to complete
- **Real-world Analogy**: Traffic jam caused by slow vehicle in front

#### FCFS Characteristics
**Advantages**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Fair in the sense of first-come, first-served
- No starvation (every process eventually gets CPU)
- Low overhead

**Disadvantages**:
- Poor average waiting time performance
- Convoy effect problem
- Not suitable for interactive systems
- Inefficient for systems with mixed workload (CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes)

**Best Suited For**:
- Batch systems where fairness is more important than efficiency
- Systems with similar process characteristics
- Simple embedded systems

### 5.3.2 Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling ‚ö°

**Principle**: Select the process with the smallest CPU burst time for execution.

#### Algorithm Description
- **Selection Criteria**: Choose process with minimum CPU burst time
- **Optimality**: Provably optimal for minimizing average waiting time
- **Tie Breaking**: Use FCFS for processes with equal burst times
- **Implementation Challenge**: Requires knowledge of CPU burst times

#### SJF Example
**Processes with CPU burst times**:
- P‚ÇÅ: 6ms, P‚ÇÇ: 8ms, P‚ÇÉ: 7ms, P‚ÇÑ: 3ms

**Execution Order**: P‚ÇÑ ‚Üí P‚ÇÅ ‚Üí P‚ÇÉ ‚Üí P‚ÇÇ

**Gantt Chart**:
```
P‚ÇÑ   P‚ÇÅ      P‚ÇÉ       P‚ÇÇ
0    3       9        16       24
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Waiting Times**: P‚ÇÅ = 3ms, P‚ÇÇ = 16ms, P‚ÇÉ = 9ms, P‚ÇÑ = 0ms
- **Average Waiting Time**: (3 + 16 + 9 + 0)/4 = 7ms
- **Comparison with FCFS**: Would be (0 + 6 + 14 + 21)/4 = 10.25ms

#### Preemptive SJF (Shortest-Remaining-Time-First - SRTF) üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Principle**: If a new process arrives with CPU burst time less than remaining time of current executing process, preempt the current process.

#### SRTF Example
**Processes with arrival times and burst times**:
- P‚ÇÅ: Arrival = 0ms, Burst = 8ms
- P‚ÇÇ: Arrival = 1ms, Burst = 4ms  
- P‚ÇÉ: Arrival = 2ms, Burst = 9ms
- P‚ÇÑ: Arrival = 3ms, Burst = 5ms

**Execution Timeline**:
- **0-1ms**: P‚ÇÅ runs (remaining = 7ms)
- **1ms**: P‚ÇÇ arrives (4ms < 7ms), preempt P‚ÇÅ
- **1-2ms**: P‚ÇÇ runs (remaining = 3ms)
- **2ms**: P‚ÇÉ arrives (9ms > 3ms), continue P‚ÇÇ
- **2-3ms**: P‚ÇÇ runs (remaining = 2ms)
- **3ms**: P‚ÇÑ arrives (5ms > 2ms), continue P‚ÇÇ
- **3-5ms**: P‚ÇÇ completes
- **5-10ms**: P‚ÇÑ runs (5ms < 7ms)
- **10-17ms**: P‚ÇÅ completes
- **17-26ms**: P‚ÇÉ completes

**Gantt Chart**:
```
P‚ÇÅ  P‚ÇÇ    P‚ÇÇ  P‚ÇÑ     P‚ÇÅ       P‚ÇÉ
0   1     2   3      5        10       17       26
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Waiting Times**: P‚ÇÅ = (0) + (10-1) = 9ms, P‚ÇÇ = (1-1) = 0ms, P‚ÇÉ = (17-2) = 15ms, P‚ÇÑ = (5-3) = 2ms
- **Average Waiting Time**: (9 + 0 + 15 + 2)/4 = 6.5ms

#### Estimating CPU Burst Time üìä

Since exact CPU burst times are unknown, they must be estimated:

**Exponential Averaging Formula**:
œÑ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = Œ± √ó t‚Çô + (1-Œ±) √ó œÑ‚Çô

Where:
- **œÑ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ**: Predicted CPU burst time for next execution
- **t‚Çô**: Actual CPU burst time of nth execution  
- **œÑ‚Çô**: Predicted CPU burst time for nth execution
- **Œ±**: Smoothing parameter (0 ‚â§ Œ± ‚â§ 1)

**Parameter Œ± Effects**:
- **Œ± = 0**: œÑ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = œÑ‚Çô (only history matters, recent behavior ignored)
- **Œ± = 1**: œÑ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = t‚Çô (only most recent behavior matters)
- **Typical Œ±**: 0.5 (balances recent and historical data)

**Expansion of Formula**:
œÑ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ = Œ± √ó t‚Çô + (1-Œ±) √ó Œ± √ó t‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ + (1-Œ±)¬≤ √ó Œ± √ó t‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÇ + ... + (1-Œ±)‚Åø √ó œÑ‚ÇÄ

**Interpretation**: More recent CPU bursts have higher weights in prediction

#### SJF Characteristics

**Advantages**:
- **Optimal**: Minimizes average waiting time
- **Good throughput**: Short jobs complete quickly
- **Efficient**: Reduces convoy effect

**Disadvantages**:
- **Starvation**: Long processes may never execute
- **Unpredictable**: CPU burst time estimation is difficult
- **Overhead**: Preemptive version requires context switching
- **Unfair**: Favors short processes over long ones

**Applications**:
- Batch systems with known job characteristics
- Systems where process behavior can be predicted
- Situations where minimizing average waiting time is crucial

### 5.3.3 Round-Robin (RR) Scheduling üé°

**Principle**: Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time quantum), after which it's preempted and moved to the end of the ready queue.

#### Algorithm Description
- **Time Quantum**: Fixed time slice (typically 10-100 milliseconds)
- **Queue Structure**: Circular FIFO queue
- **Preemption**: Occurs when time quantum expires
- **Fair Sharing**: Each process gets equal CPU time allocation
- **Implementation**: Uses timer interrupt to enforce time quantum

#### Round-Robin Example
**Processes with CPU burst times**:
- P‚ÇÅ: 24ms, P‚ÇÇ: 3ms, P‚ÇÉ: 3ms
- **Time Quantum**: 4ms

**Execution Timeline**:
1. **0-4ms**: P‚ÇÅ runs (remaining = 20ms)
2. **4-7ms**: P‚ÇÇ runs (remaining = 0ms, completes)
3. **7-10ms**: P‚ÇÉ runs (remaining = 0ms, completes)  
4. **10-14ms**: P‚ÇÅ runs (remaining = 16ms)
5. **14-18ms**: P‚ÇÅ runs (remaining = 12ms)
6. **18-22ms**: P‚ÇÅ runs (remaining = 8ms)
7. **22-26ms**: P‚ÇÅ runs (remaining = 4ms)
8. **26-30ms**: P‚ÇÅ runs (remaining = 0ms, completes)

**Gantt Chart**:
```
P‚ÇÅ   P‚ÇÇ  P‚ÇÉ  P‚ÇÅ   P‚ÇÅ   P‚ÇÅ   P‚ÇÅ   P‚ÇÅ
0    4   7   10   14   18   22   26   30
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Waiting Times**: 
  - P‚ÇÅ = (0) + (10-4) + (14-10) + (18-14) + (22-18) + (26-22) = 0 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22ms
  - P‚ÇÇ = (4-0) = 4ms
  - P‚ÇÉ = (7-0) = 7ms
- **Average Waiting Time**: (22 + 4 + 7)/3 = 11ms

#### Time Quantum Selection ‚è∞

**Impact of Time Quantum Size**:

**Small Time Quantum (q ‚Üí 0)**:
- **Advantage**: Better response time, approaches processor sharing
- **Disadvantage**: High overhead due to frequent context switches
- **Extreme Case**: Each process gets 1ms, but context switch takes 1ms ‚Üí 50% overhead

**Large Time Quantum (q ‚Üí ‚àû)**:
- **Advantage**: Low context switching overhead
- **Disadvantage**: Degenerates to FCFS scheduling
- **Poor responsiveness**: Long processes cause delays

**Optimal Time Quantum**:
- **Rule of Thumb**: 80% of CPU bursts should be shorter than time quantum
- **Typical Range**: 10-100 milliseconds
- **Context Switch Time**: Should be < 10% of time quantum
- **System Dependent**: Varies based on system characteristics and workload

#### Time Quantum Examples

**Example with Different Time Quanta**:
**Processes**: P‚ÇÅ = 6ms, P‚ÇÇ = 3ms, P‚ÇÉ = 1ms, P‚ÇÑ = 7ms

**With q = 1ms**:
```
P‚ÇÅ P‚ÇÇ P‚ÇÉ P‚ÇÑ P‚ÇÅ P‚ÇÇ P‚ÇÑ P‚ÇÅ P‚ÇÇ P‚ÇÑ P‚ÇÅ P‚ÇÑ P‚ÇÅ P‚ÇÑ P‚ÇÅ P‚ÇÑ P‚ÇÑ
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
```
- High overhead, many context switches

**With q = 4ms**:  
```
P‚ÇÅ   P‚ÇÇ  P‚ÇÉ P‚ÇÑ   P‚ÇÅ  P‚ÇÑ
0    4   7  8    12  14   17
```
- Better balance of responsiveness and efficiency

#### Round-Robin Characteristics

**Advantages**:
- **Fair**: Equal CPU time sharing among processes
- **No Starvation**: Every process gets CPU time periodically
- **Good Response Time**: Especially for interactive systems
- **Simple**: Easy to implement and understand
- **Preemptive**: Prevents long processes from monopolizing CPU

**Disadvantages**:
- **Context Switch Overhead**: Frequent preemption causes overhead
- **Poor Average Waiting Time**: Generally higher than SJF
- **Time Quantum Selection**: Difficult to choose optimal value
- **Poor for CPU-bound Processes**: Inefficient for long computations

**Best Suited For**:
- **Time-sharing systems**: Multiple interactive users
- **Interactive systems**: Desktop environments, web servers
- **Real-time systems**: When bounded response time is needed
- **Fair resource allocation**: When equal treatment is important

#### Performance Comparison Summary

**Algorithm Comparison for Same Process Set**:
- **FCFS**: Simple but poor average waiting time, convoy effect
- **SJF**: Optimal average waiting time but potential starvation
- **SRTF**: Better than SJF for mixed arrival times, more overhead
- **Round-Robin**: Fair sharing, good response time, higher average waiting time

**Selection Guidelines**:
- **Batch Systems**: FCFS or SJF
- **Interactive Systems**: Round-Robin
- **Mixed Workload**: Multilevel queue (combining multiple algorithms)
- **Real-time Systems**: Priority-based scheduling
